Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that differs from React and Vue in that
it moves most of the work from the browser to the compilation stage.
Instead of a virtual DOM, Svelte directly transforms components into highly efficient JavaScript code.
Svelte is known for its small bundle size and high performance.
